# Exercise: Counting Vowels in a String Using Static Methods

## Objective
Learn how to create a static method in Java that counts the number of vowels in a given string.

## Instructions

**Counting Vowels with a Static Method**

In this project, you will create a static method that counts the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in a string. Assume that the string is all lowercase.

### Steps for You to Do:

1. **Declare Static Method:**
    - Create a static method called `countVowels` that:
        - **Returns:** an integer
        - **Takes:** a String called `s`
    - Inside the method, write logic to count the number of vowels in the string `s`.

2. **Main Method:**
    - Inside the main method, call the `countVowels` method with different string inputs and print the results.

### Example InputOutput:

- `countVowels("obama")` ==> 3
- `countVowels("happy friday! i love weekends")` ==> 9

### Purpose:

- The `countVowels` method will loop through each character in the string `s` and count how many times any of the vowels (a, e, i, o, u) appear.

## Tips:
- Use a for loop to iterate through each character of the string.
- Check whether each character is one of the vowels (a, e, i, o, u).

## Troubleshooting:
- If the output doesn't match the expected result, ensure that the loop is correctly checking for vowels in the string.
- Make sure the method is returning the correct count of vowels.

By completing this exercise, you will improve your understanding of how to use loops and static methods in Java to manipulate strings. Happy coding!
