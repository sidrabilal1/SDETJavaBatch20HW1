# Exercise: Managing Product IDs for Warehouse Inventory Using an ArrayList

## Objective
Learn how to use an ArrayList in Java to manage and retrieve specific product IDs from warehouse inventory. You will add product IDs to an ArrayList and retrieve specific items to verify them during an inventory check.

## Instructions

**Step 1: Create an ArrayList of Product IDs**

1. **Create the `E174ProductInventory.java` class** with the following:
    - **ArrayList Initialization:**
        - Initialize an `ArrayList<Integer>` to store product IDs.
    - **Add Product IDs:**
        - Add the following product IDs to the list: `1011`, `1022`, `1033`, `1044`, `1055`, `1066`.
    - **Retrieve Specific Product IDs:**
        - Retrieve the 1st, 3rd, and 5th product IDs from the list and print them to verify the products during the inventory check.

**Step 2: Print the Results**

1. **Main Method:**
    - Print the values of the 1st, 3rd, and 5th products from the inventory list.

## Example InputOutput:

**Expected Output:**

```plaintext
1011
1033
1055
```

## Tips:

- **ArrayList Operations:** Use the `get(index)` method to retrieve specific elements from an ArrayList.
- **Real-World Example:** This exercise simulates managing product IDs in a warehouse inventory system, where specific product IDs are checked for stock during an inventory count.

Happy coding!
