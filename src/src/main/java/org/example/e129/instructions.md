# Exercise: Working with Static Variables and Methods

## Objective
Learn how to declare and use static variables in Java, and create methods that display their values.

## Instructions

**Using Static Variables and Methods**

In this project, you will declare two static variables and create a method to display their values in a formatted string.

### Steps for You to Do:

1. **Declare Static Variables:**
    - Declare two static variables:
        - A static variable called `countryName` to hold the name of a country.
        - A static variable called `continent` to hold the name of a continent.

2. **Create a Static Method:**
    - Create a static method called `display` that prints the values of the static variables in the following format:
      ```
      ____ located on ____ continent
      ```
      Example:
      ```
      Morocco located on Africa continent
      ```

3. **Main Method:**
    - Inside the main method, assign values to the static variables and execute the `display` method.


### Example Output:
- `Morocco located on Africa continent`

## Tips:
- Make sure to declare your static variables outside of any method so that they can be accessed by all methods in the class.
- Call the static method directly from the main method without needing to create an instance of the class.

## Troubleshooting:
- If your program doesn't compile, ensure that all static variables and methods are properly defined.
- If the output is incorrect, check that you have correctly assigned values to the static variables before calling the `display` method.

By completing this exercise, you will understand how to declare static variables and methods, and how to print their values in Java. Happy coding!
