# Exercise: Managing Product Order Quantities Using an ArrayList

## Objective
Learn how to use an ArrayList in Java to manage the quantities of products ordered in an e-commerce system. You will store multiple quantities of two products in the list and print each value to verify the order details.

## Instructions

**Step 1: Create an ArrayList for Product Quantities**

1. **Create the `E175OrderManagement.java` class** with the following:
    - **ArrayList Initialization:**
        - Initialize an `ArrayList<Integer>` to store quantities of products ordered.
    - **Add Product Quantities:**
        - Add the following quantities to the list for **Product A** and **Product B**:
            - `111, 111, 111` (representing 3 orders of Product A)
            - `999, 999, 999` (representing 3 orders of Product B)
    - **Print Product Quantities:**
        - Loop through the ArrayList and print each quantity to confirm the order details.

**Step 2: Print the Results**

1. **Main Method:**
    - Print each product order quantity from the list, one by one, to verify that all orders were recorded correctly.

## Example InputOutput:

**Expected Output:**

```plaintext
111
111
111
999
999
999
```

## Tips:

- **ArrayList Operations:** Use a loop (e.g., a `for` or `for-each` loop) to print each element in the ArrayList.
- **Real-World Example:** This exercise simulates managing and verifying product order quantities in an e-commerce system, where multiple orders for different products are recorded and need to be printed out for confirmation.

Happy coding!
