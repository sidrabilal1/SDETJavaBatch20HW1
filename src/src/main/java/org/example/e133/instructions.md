# Exercise: Counting Occurrences of 'a' or 'A' Using Static Methods

## Objective
Learn how to create a static method in Java that counts the occurrences of a specific character in a string.

## Instructions

**Counting Occurrences with a Static Method**

In this project, you will create a static method that counts the number of occurrences of the character 'a' or 'A' within a string.

### Steps for You to Do:

1. **Declare Static Method:**
    - Create a static method called `countA` that:
        - **Returns:** an integer
        - **Takes:** a String called `s`
    - Inside the method, write logic to count the occurrences of 'a' or 'A' in the string `s`.

2. **Main Method:**
    - Inside the main method, call the `countA` method with different string inputs and print the results.

### Example InputOutput:

- `countA("aaa")` ==> 3
- `countA("aaBBdf8k3AAadnklA")` ==> 6

### Purpose:

- The `countA` method will loop through each character in the string `s` and count how many times 'a' or 'A' appears.

## Tips:
- Use a for loop to iterate through each character of the string.
- Remember to check for both lowercase 'a' and uppercase 'A'.

## Troubleshooting:
- If the output doesn't match the expected result, ensure that the loop is correctly checking for both 'a' and 'A' in the string.
- Make sure the method is returning the count of occurrences correctly.

By completing this exercise, you will improve your understanding of how to use loops and static methods in Java to manipulate strings. Happy coding!
