# Exercise: Tracking Monthly Sales and Calculating Total in a LinkedList

## Objective
Learn how to use a `LinkedList` in Java to store monthly sales figures, calculate the total sales for the year, and print the result. This exercise simulates a real-life scenario where you need to track monthly sales in a retail store and sum them up to get the total annual sales.

## Instructions

**Step 1: Create a LinkedList of Monthly Sales**

1. **Create the `E183MonthlySales.java` class** with the following:
    - **LinkedList Initialization:**
        - Initialize a `LinkedList<Integer>` to store monthly sales figures.

**Step 2: Add Monthly Sales to the LinkedList**

1. **Add the following monthly sales figures to the LinkedList**:
    - Sales for January: `11100`
    - Sales for February: `12200`
    - Sales for March: `13300`
    - Sales for April: `14400`
    - Sales for May: `15500`
    - Sales for June: `16600`

**Step 3: Calculate the Total Sales for the Year**

1. **Use a loop to sum all the sales figures**:
    - Loop through the `LinkedList` using an enhanced `for` loop.
    - Accumulate the sum of the sales figures.

**Step 4: Print the Result**

1. **Print the final result** showing the total sales for the year.

## Example InputOutput:

**Output:**

```plaintext
Total sales for the year: 83100
```

## Tips:

- **LinkedList Operations:** Use the `add()` method to add sales figures to the LinkedList.
- **Summing Logic:** Use a loop to iterate over the LinkedList and accumulate the total sales.
- **Real-World Example:** Tracking monthly sales and calculating annual totals is a common operation in retail, e-commerce, and other industries where revenue needs to be monitored and reported.

Happy coding!
