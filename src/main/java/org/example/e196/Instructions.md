# Exercise: Managing Departments and Employees Using Map of Lists

## Objective
Learn how to use a **Map of Lists** in Java to manage groups of related items, such as employees in a department. In this exercise, each department will be a key in the map, and the list of employees in that department will be the associated value.

## Scenario
You are tasked with managing employees in different departments of a company. Your goal is to store the department names as keys and the list of employees as values in a `Map of Lists`. This way, all employees in a department can be easily accessed and managed together.



## Instructions

### Step 1: Initialize the Map and Lists

1. **Initialize a `Map<String, List<String>>` to store departments and employees.**
    - Create an empty map that will have the department names as keys and lists of employees as values.

2. **Create ArrayLists for Employees in Each Department**:
    - For each department, create an ArrayList to store the employee names.
    - **Hint**: You can use `ArrayList<String>` for storing employee names.

### Step 2: Add Employees to the Lists

1. **Add Employees to Each ArrayList**:
    - For example:
        - Add `Alice` and `Bob` to the HR department's list.
        - Add `Charlie`, `David`, and `Eve` to the IT department's list.

### Step 3: Add the Employee Lists to the Map

1. **Use the `put()` method to add each department and its corresponding employee list to the map**:
    - Associate the HR department with the list of HR employees.
    - Associate the IT department with the list of IT employees.

### Step 4: Print Each Department and Employees

1. **Use a `for-each` loop to access each entry (department and its employee list) from the map**:
    - First, get each department (key) and the corresponding employee list (value) using a loop.
    - Then, print the department name followed by its employees.

## Example Output:

```plaintext
Department: HR Employees: [Alice, Bob]
Department: IT Employees: [Charlie, David, Eve]
Department: Finance Employees: [Frank, Grace]

## Why Use Loops and Map Methods to Access Data?

**Key Points to Remember**:
- **Efficient Retrieval**: Loops provide a powerful way to efficiently retrieve and process data from a map. Whether you need to access just the keys (department names), the values (employee lists), or both (key-value pairs), loops allow you to do this quickly and cleanly.
- **Map Methods**:
    - **`keySet()`**: Retrieves all the keys (e.g., department names) in the map. This is useful when you only need to work with the names or titles of collections without accessing their contents.
    - **`values()`**: Retrieves all the values (e.g., employee lists) in the map. This is helpful when you need to process or manipulate the actual data inside the lists but donâ€™t need the keys.
    - **`entrySet()`**: Retrieves both the keys and values as a set of `Map.Entry` objects. This method is great when you need to work with both the category (department) and the associated data (employees) at the same time.
- **Real-Life Application**: Managing a **student or employee database** is a common task in many organizations. Using maps and loops allows you to efficiently manage records, retrieve data, generate reports, and perform other operations in an organized way.
