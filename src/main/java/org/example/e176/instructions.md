# Exercise: Managing Warehouse Inventory Using an ArrayList

## Objective
Learn how to use an ArrayList in Java to manage product inventory in a warehouse. You will add product IDs to the inventory, print the list of products, then simulate clearing the inventory by removing all elements and printing the list again.

## Instructions

**Step 1: Create an ArrayList for Product IDs**

1. **Create the `E176WarehouseInventory.java` class** with the following:
    - **ArrayList Initialization:**
        - Initialize an `ArrayList<Integer>` to store product IDs.
    - **Add Product IDs:**
        - Add the following product IDs to the list:
            - `111, 222, 333, 444, 555, 666`
    - **Print Product IDs:**
        - Print the list of product IDs to verify the inventory.
    - **Clear Inventory:**
        - Use the `clear()` method to remove all items from the list.
    - **Print the Empty List:**
        - Print the list again to confirm that all elements have been removed.

**Step 2: Print the Results**

1. **Main Method:**
    - Print the list before and after removing the elements to simulate an inventory check and clearance process.

## Example InputOutput:

**Expected Output:**

```plaintext
[111, 222, 333, 444, 555, 666]
[]
```

## Tips:

- **ArrayList Operations:** Use the `clear()` method to remove all elements from an ArrayList.
- **Real-World Example:** This exercise simulates a warehouse inventory system where product IDs are managed. The inventory is printed before and after clearing it, representing an inventory check and clearance process.

Happy coding!
